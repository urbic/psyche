<para>
Execution semantics depends on the objectâ€™s type, as well as whether the object
was received by the parser or in another way. Execution can be either
<firstterm>immediate</firstterm><indexterm><primary>execution</primary><secondary>immediate</secondary></indexterm>,
which performed as soon as the object is created by the parser, or
<firstterm>deferred</firstterm><indexterm><primary>execution</primary><secondary>deferred</secondary></indexterm>.
